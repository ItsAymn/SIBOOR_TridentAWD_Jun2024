Improves frame rigidity. Might be possible to use as a 'squaring-guide' when assembling the frame. I would recommend using at least 2040 corner brackets. Could 3D print some brackets (PLANNED)

- [ ] 16x 2020 Brackets (Plenty on AliExpress)
- [ ] 32x M5 Hammerhead Nuts

## Motion System

| -------------- | --------------- |

Found to help with VFA, good tuning may help. QoL upgrade if anything. Cables need terminating. Cables are nicely twisted with spaced zipties, don't bother trimming and just bunch them.

Cooler Steppers = Lower Resistace = Higher Current = Stonks. Probably only worth doing heatsink and fans if running a stepper tune.
